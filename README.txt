INF133-FinalProject

Overview: 
The codex project displays a desktop-friendly database of different foods and their categories, as provided by TheMealDB API. 
Once the codex 
loads, the user is given a display of random foods. When one of these items is hovered over or clicked by the user, 
information about it is displayed on the right side of the screen. This information mainly revolves around the recipe for that dish, 
including a picture, adescription (including ingredients), and instructions on how to prepare it. This recipe codex provides 
convenient and helpful information for users in a user-friendly and appealing manner. We utilized HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Bootstrap, 
and Angular for the codex project.
